<h2>Problem statement</h2>

You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4

Output: 12.75000

Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

<h4>Constraints</h4>

n == nums.length

1 <= k <= n <= 105

-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
