<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]

Output: 3

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

<h4>Constraints</h4>
