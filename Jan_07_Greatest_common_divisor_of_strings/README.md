<h2>Problem statement</h2>

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"

Output: "ABC"

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<p>1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000</p>
<p>str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.</p>
