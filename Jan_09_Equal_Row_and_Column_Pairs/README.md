<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid, return the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]

Output: 1

Explanation: There is 1 equal row and column pair:

- (Row 2, Column 1): [2,7,7]

<h4>Constraints</h4>

n == grid.length == grid[i].length

1 <= n <= 200

1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
