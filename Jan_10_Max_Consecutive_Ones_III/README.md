<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

<h4>Constraints</h4>

1 <= nums.length <= 105

nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

0 <= k <= nums.length
