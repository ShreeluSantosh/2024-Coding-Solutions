<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]

<h4>Constraints</h4>

2 <= nums.length <= 105

-30 <= nums[i] <= 30

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
