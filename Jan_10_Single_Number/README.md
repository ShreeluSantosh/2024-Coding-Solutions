<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

<h4>Constraints</h4>

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104

-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104

Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
