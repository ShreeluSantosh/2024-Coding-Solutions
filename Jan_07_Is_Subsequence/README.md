<h2>Problem statement</h2>

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

<h3>Example:</h3>

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Output: true

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<p>1 <= s.length <= 100</p>
<p>0 <= t.length <= 104</p>
<p>s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.</p>
